            onto me. All offenses mentioned in the filing have in fact been committed by Mridu against me.
            A systematic, calculated, opportunistic and malicious campaign has been launched by Mridu
            against me after I filed for divorce and custody of their minor child after undergoing years of
            physical violence and mental abuse at the hands of Mridu. There is good reason to believe that
            Mridu suffers from mental problems as will be shown below, and I fear for Adarsh’s safety until
            Mridu undergoes a comprehensive psychic evaluation. From my side I have tried to keep this
            divorce a completely respectable and fair process by keeping my distance from Mridu and
            requesting for 50-50 custody of Adarsh, but Mridu on the other hand has been engaging in
            malicious and hurtful activities towards me especially after the divorce by way of getting me
            arrested on a false charge of domestic violence and child abuse, alleging abuse by people who
            have been supporting me in this difficult time and filing this restraining order on completely

            Ms. Arya had been emotionally and physically abusive throughout our marriage. I was on a work
            visa for the most part of our marriage. She used to say that if I ever called the cops then she
            would make up some story, get me arrested and then I would eventually get deported because I
            was an immigrant. The abuse continued, I did not call the cops because of this threat, and I did
            not collect evidence because I was naive enough to think that this would come in between me
            making my marriage work. I have documented all incidents of abuse over these years, but one
            particular incident stands out. On Dec 3rd 2016, when I was driving on freeway 101N, Ms. Arya
            and Adarsh were in the back seat. We were having an argument, and she started kicking my
            head. When I stopped the car on the shoulder to prevent an accident, she started hitting my
            head with a cell phone. I then called 911 while she was trying to snatch my phone away from
            me. Ms. Arya made up a story that if the cops came, they would take Adarsh away. So, I hung
            up the phone. The 911 operator tried to call me back 3 times, but I did not answer, and I just
            drove back home with a swollen left eye and a swollen head.

                    her mother, and Shree’s daughter. She put in personal and private photos/videos in there too.
                    Shree got to know about this when she was called by her cousin from Canada who got an
                    anonymous message on Facebook about the website. When Shree saw the website she had a
                    nervous breakdown and an anxiety attack. I called and emailed South San Francisco PD to
                    complain about the website, but they said there is nothing they could do. I also sent emails to
                    GoDaddy and FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center about this, but they could not help me.

                Ms. Arya created the website shreecult.com full of false and defamatory material about Shree,
                her mother, and Shree’s daughter. She put in personal and private photos/videos in there too.
                Shree got to know about this when she was called by her cousin from Canada who got an
                anonymous message on Facebook about the website. When Shree saw the website she had a
                nervous breakdown and an anxiety attack. I called and emailed South San Francisco PD to
                complain about the website, but they said there is nothing they could do. I also sent emails to
                GoDaddy and FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center about this, but they could not help me.

            <p class="text-muted px-2 text-white lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The allegations that I (and previously Mridu) are/were part of a cult are malicious, defamatory
              and unfounded. It was Mridu that first introduced me to Ms. Shree Lal’s (henceforth referred to
              as Shree, someone whom I consider as my mother) residence on Oct 26th 2011 on the
              occasion of the Indian festival of Diwali. This was the first time I met Shree. I had agreed to go
              only because I was forced by Mridu for doing so. Mridu had emotionally blackmailed me saying
              that if I loved her then I would do as she says. Mridu held Shree in very high standing and on
              the same day mentioned to me that Shree had taken Mridu out of her depression and suicidal
              tendencies from her broken past relationship. Mridu also mentioned on the same day that Shree
              held spiritual prayers every Thursday at her residence from 7.30pm to 8.30pm and that it was an
              event only for close friends and family. Mridu and I started going for the Thursday prayers
              regularly after that point. At no point of time did Shree insist that we come for the Thursday
              prayers nor did she ever question us if we missed Thursday prayers.
              The negative connotation of the word “cult” is implied in the allegations here where it is loosely
              being referred to as a place where people are held against their will, brainwashed and exploited.
              Shree has never invited anyone to these prayer meetings and people only come by the word of
              mouth. Shree has never restrained anyone from leaving this place, people come and go
              completely by their own free will. She has never insisted that anyone pay her money for coming
              to the prayers nor has she ever attempted to brainwash or exploit anyone in any way. This place
              is her residence where she lives with her old mother, handicapped sister and her four children,
              1
              
              and hence she tries to limit the people that come on Thursdays to 20-30 to keep the privacy
              intrusions to a minimum.</p>

        On Oct 12th 2021 at 11am I got a call from the South San Francisco PD asking me to come in
for questioning around my custody. When I got there, I was told that Ms. Arya had accused me
of molesting my son. Ms. Arya had sent them a clip of a 4yr old video where I am seen
massaging a 1yr old Adarsh. We massage babies in the Indian culture so that they sleep well,
their muscles become stronger and their skin remains healthy. I then showed the police a video
of Ms. Arya massaging a naked 6 month old Adarsh, and asked them if this is molestation as
well. I explained to them that this very video and this issue had been addressed in detail when
she brought this up during the private child custody evaluation, and that bringing this up again is
opportunistic. I also explained to them that Ms. Arya has a history of filing false police
complaints to harass me. They talked to me for about 30-45 mins and then said that I was free
to go, but they said that CPS might be in touch with me. See Exhibit H for the case number.
When I went to South SF PD a week later to get the case report, they said that the case report

will not be available to me, and that CPS is still investigating. I have not been contacted by CPS yet.

            I filed for divorce on Apr 27th 2018. On May 23rd 2018, around 9am, after an argument Ms.
            Arya called the cops and showed them some photo where she is bleeding from the lips. The
            photo was from a year back. I have never touched her, so she had clearly scratched her lip. She
            alleged that I hit her and then her head hit Adarsh who was in her arms, so the charges were
            not only domestic violence but also child endangerment. She had clearly planned this out. The
            cops detained me, and I had to bail myself. The DA refused to prosecute the case given how
            fishy the case looked.</p>

                    seat with Mridu beside him in the back seat. Suddenly Mridu started kicking me in the
                    head from the back. Before I could understand what was going on she had kicked me
                    multiple times. I took the Whipple Rd exit on 101-N and refused to proceed to Half Moon
                    Bay and took the road back home on 101-S. Mridu then started to hit me with her

                    us were not caught up in a road accident with her hitting the driver of the car! I tried to
                    call 911, but Mridu tried to snatch my phone from me to prevent me from making the call.

                    the electric stove. The stove glass shattered and a lot of glass pieces fell to the kitchen
                    floor. I took Adarsh downstairs so that he could be away from the glass and her bad
                    mood. Mridu refused to clean the glass for the next 2 days even though Adarsh used to
                    come and go in the kitchen, so I cleaned it up myself to keep the place safe for Adarsh.

                    City, I was working on some shelves in Adarsh’s bedroom and Mridu was upstairs with
                    Adarsh. She came downstairs with Adarsh and started shouting at me that I was not
                    doing any work and was working too slowly. After that Mridu came right up to my face
                    and slapped me. I then pushed her back. Mridu then ran upstairs with Adarsh shouting
                    and screaming hysterically saying that I had hit her and Adarsh and that the cops should
                    be called. A painter named Fayyaz was working in our house those days and he was
                    working upstairs and Mridu started screaming at him to call the cops. When I reached
                    upstairs Mridu also started to scream, shout and curse at me saying that I had hit her
                    and Adarsh and that she’ll call the cops. Let it be noted that I never hit Mridu on that day,
                    and hence the charge that Adarsh got hit too is completely fabricated. Let it also be

<p class="text-muted lh-lg " style="text-align: justify;"  data-aos="fade-up"> The relentless defamation and the misuse of authorities and police enforcement by Ms. Arya
  has had a devastating effect on our family, including on Shree’s health and my health. Shree
  has been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia due to the stress because of these constant attacks by
  Ms. Arya. Fibromyalgia has no cure. Shree has pain throughout her body due to this condition,
  
  and she is always fatigued, has problems sleeping, and has memory issues. In fact, the
  allegations by Ms. Arya during the private custody evaluation became so nasty, low and
  stressful, that Shree’s doctor had to write a couple of letters explaining her health problems and
  the reasons for them. See Exhibit K for these letters. Shree’s work has suffered immensely due
  to her health condition.
  I have been diagnosed with depression since the start of 2021. In reality this has been going on
  for at least 2 years now. I have been prescribed medication (Bupropion) for managing my
  depression. See Exhibit L for this. I have been seeing a psychiatrist for my mental health. My
  work has suffered. I can no longer concentrate on work like I did, and I have been passed up
  promotions because of bad work performance.
  Shree’s children are always scared when the police show up at our home. Shree’s 11 year old
  son and 17 year old daughter are even scared to go to school in case they get questioned at
  school like Roshni was. In fact, Shree’s eldest daughter has had to take time off from her work
  to take care of the younger 2 kids and help them manage their stress and school workload.
  Roshni and Shree’s 74yr old mom (Parvati) are very scared that APS will come home again and
  not only take Roshni away from us, but also have Shree taken away by authorities under false
  pretenses like the time I was arrested for my false domestic abuse case. We pray and hope that
  this constant living under fear, these malicious attacks, harassment and persistent defamation
  stop soon.</p>

        <!-- <p class= "lh-lg " data-aos="fade-up" style="text-align: justify;"class=>This entire restraining order is an attempt to project Mridu’s personality, behavior and misdeeds
            onto me. All offenses mentioned in the filing have in fact been committed by Mridu against me.
            A systematic, calculated, opportunistic and malicious campaign has been launched by Mridu
            against me after I filed for divorce and custody of their minor child after undergoing years of
            physical violence and mental abuse at the hands of Mridu. There is good reason to believe that
            Mridu suffers from mental problems as will be shown below, and I fear for son safety until
            Mridu undergoes a comprehensive psychic evaluation. From my side I have tried to keep this
            divorce a completely respectable and fair process by keeping my distance from Mridu and
            requesting for 50-50 custody of Son, but Mridu on the other hand has been engaging in
            malicious and hurtful activities towards me especially after the divorce by way of getting me
            arrested on a false charge of domestic violence and child abuse, alleging abuse by people who
            have been supporting me in this difficult time and filing this restraining order on completely
            fabricated and manufactured incidents and evidence.</p> -->
        <p class="lh-lg " data-aos="fade-up" style="text-align: justify;">In the Serial Murder Symposium, experts
          identified certain traits common to some serial murderers, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or
          guilt, impulsivity, the need for control, and predatory behavior. These traits and behaviors are consistent
          with the psychopathic personality disorder. Despite some people not being murderers or serial murderers, this
          disorder can manifest in people who prey on the well-being of innocent people. Mridu Arya is one such
          psychopath, but one who presents with an innocent and sociable face.</p>

                Mridu’s modus operandi is very simple but very deadly for her victim. Befriend a guy, establish physical
                relations with him soon after so that he does not go away from her. Fake a family situation to get the
                guy to accept a live-in relationship. Then, very soon act like a pious person who is repulsed by live-in
                relationships, and emotionally blackmail the guy into proposing marriage so that the live-in
                relationship can be legitimized. And then, Mridu slowly lets her psychopathic tendencies come to the
                fore. Verbal abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, emotional abuse and the worst - physical abuse. Four
                ex-boyfriends of Mridu were lucky enough to get out of her schemes before they got completely stuck in
                them. But, her ex-husband and his innocent family were not so lucky. <span id="op-para">They are suffering from the
                misdeeds of a person who is so devious, that she has completely destroyed many families but has still
                not been held accountable for any of her crimes. Despite her ex-husband having filed for divorce almost
                5 years back, Mridu has managed to constantly delay finalization of the divorce and has also managed to
                maliciously keep their son away from his father, both only for monetary gain.</span>

He is in therapy and on medication for chronic depression and PTSD, but lucky to be just alive. He has not been allowed to spend a single Father’s Day with his son. For the past 5 years he has not been allowed to be with his son on his son’s birthday. Because of repeated CPS cases he has not been allowed to meet or talk to his son since December 2021. His mental state has affected not only his work but also his personal relations. Through all of this, he continues to see his sister Siya and her family being systematically destroyed due to the viciousness of an evil person.

                  Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that often occurs in abusive relationships. It is a covert type of emotional abuse in which the bully or abuser misleads the target, creating a false narrative and making them question their judgments and reality. Ultimately, the victim of gaslighting starts to feel unsure about their perceptions of the world <span id="tm1">and even wonder if they are losing their sanity.
                  
                  Merriam-Webster defines gaslighting as the "psychological manipulation of a person usually over an extended period of time that causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories and typically leads to confusion, loss of confidence and self-esteem, uncertainty of one's emotional or mental stability, and a dependency on the perpetrator."
                  
                  Gaslighting primarily occurs in romantic relationships, but it's not uncommon in controlling friendships or among family members as well. People who gaslight others may have mental health disorders. They use this type of emotional abuse to exert power over others to manipulate friends, family members, or even co-workers.

          </p>
          <p class="text-muted px-2 text-white lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;"> Psychopathy is a personality
            disorder manifested in people who use a mixture of charm, manipulation, intimidation, and occasionally
            violence to control others, in order to satisfy their own selfish needs. Although the concept of psychopathy
            has been known for centuries, Dr. Robert Hare led the modern research effort to develop a series of
            assessment tools, to evaluate the personality traits and behaviors attributable to psychopaths.
            Dr. Hare and his associates developed the Psychopathy Check List Revised (PCL-R) and its derivatives, which
            provide a clinical assessment of the degree of psychopathy an individual possesses. These instruments
            measure the distinct cluster of personality traits and socially-deviant behaviors of an individual, which
            fall into four factors: interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and anti-social.
            <span id="psy-para"> interpersonal traits include glibness, superficial charm, a grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological
            lying, and the manipulation of others. The affective traits include a lack of remorse and/or guilt, shallow
            affect, a lack of empathy, and failure to accept responsibility. The lifestyle behaviors include
            stimulation-seeking behavior, impulsivity, irresponsibility, parasitic orientation, and a lack of realistic
            life goals. The anti-social behaviors include poor behavioral controls, early childhood behavior problems,
            juvenile delinquency, revocation of conditional release, and criminal versatility. The combination of these
            individual personality traits, interpersonal styles, and socially deviant lifestyles are the framework of
            psychopathy and can manifest themselves differently in individual psychopaths.

          Mridu and her ex-husband’s son’s childhood has been destroyed because of his mother’s greed and jealousy. He has seen his mother physically abuse his father over and over again. This left such a big psychological scar on the then 1 year old child that he used to hit his head on the wall and hide behind furniture. Mridu used to take off with their son to her mother’s place for days together just to torture her ex-husband, by keeping a son away from his father. A mother who can start kicking the driver of a car in which their 6 month old son is sitting can be nothing short of mentally unstable.

The son has seen his father being arrested on the fake domestic violence charge, and started running behind the cop car in which his father was being taken away. A child who is now 6 years old, he has been without a father since he was a 1 year old. During supervised visitation, Mridu’s ex-husband had seen injuries and bruises on their son’s face for 4 consecutive weeks. These injuries were consistent with either negligence by the mother, or even worse, abuse by her. Scared, he called CPS to make sure that his son was not being mistreated. Somehow, Mridu managed to get out unscathed from that case.

<span id="evilpara">The degree of evil that Mridu could stoop down to was seen when her ex-husband was finally awarded some non-supervised custody by the court in September 2021. Enraged at the court’s decision, Mridu launched a CPS case based on nasty allegations of child sexual abuse. The way she tried to prove these allegations will send chills down anyone’s spine. She, a mother, instructed their 5 year old son to strip down naked, and taught him how to play with his genitals. She filmed him doing this, and sent over this video to the CPS social worker alleging that he learned how to do this when he was with his father. After the social worker and the police interviewed the father, they found gaps in the mother's story. So, luckily Mridu’s plan did not succeed. Mridu has also been trying to brainwash their son by constantly telling him that his father abuses him and doesn’t even give him food to eat. A mother who can use and abuse her son like this only for her selfish motives can be nothing other than a psychopath.</span>

Mridu has fully benefited from all that she has done. Everything was very carefully planned. A week after her ex-husband filed for divorce, she left her job so that she gets 100% alimony payments. To this day she has not taken up, nor felt the need to take up a job. The ploy to fight for 100% child custody was only to get 100% child support money. She gets $6,000 each month in alimony and child support payments. She got $120,000 from the court-ordered sale of the marital house, a house that she did not spend a single penny on. She got the family car, a Lexus. She gets free health insurance from her ex-husband. She is set to get 50% of her ex-husband’s 401(k) and stocks. She has made full use of the fact that her ex-husband pays for her attorneys by going through no less than 5 attorneys in the divorce case, and firing them whenever they gave her sound advice to settle the case.

It is a story of unimaginable proportions and the degree to which someone can be heartless enough to not only destroy the lives of innocent people, but also that of her own son in a dangerous game of jealousy and revenge.
        Mridu’s ex-husband warned her that he would involve law enforcement for these crimes, but he was on a work visa and she is a U.S. citizen. She threatened him saying that she will make up a fake abuse case, get him arrested, and eventually get him deported back to India.</p>

Mridu took their 2 year old son in her hands, used a bruise kit and fake blood paint, dabbed it on her lips and the cheeks of their son, and took a photo. She then called the cops crying and showed them the photo. The police arrested the ex-husband and sent him to jail on charges of domestic violence and cruelty against a child. Shocked and in tears, her ex-husband managed to bail himself out on a bond of $5,000. Since the ex-husband could not go back to their house after bailing out, his sister (we’ll call her Siya from here on) and her family took him into their home. After reviewing the suspicious evidence, the District Attorney refused to prosecute the case.</p>

Mridu called Adult Protective Services (APS) on Siya, with the allegation that Siya was abusing her own sister (we’ll call her Riya from here on). Riya is handicapped and has cerebral palsy. On Oct 24th 2018, APS barged into Siya’s home, and interrogated the bed-ridden Riya for an hour to see if the allegations were true. A confused and frightened Riya told APS that this must be some joke because Siya takes good care of her and she is very happy. On Nov 1st 2018 APS visited the special-needs school of Riya and again asked her the same questions. Riya gave them the same answers as before. The case was closed as unfounded. Besides Riya’s physical problems, after these incidents she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and still lives in the constant fear that she will be separated from her loving family.</p>

This caused a deep level of mistrust, anger and aggression from these people towards her. Siya has been getting threatening and nasty phone calls ever since the website was published.

    <strong><i class="far fa-hand-point-right mx-2 text-primary"></i></strong> After Siya’s young school-going children saw the website, they were inconsolable, to the extent that it started affecting their school-work. Siya's eldest daughter had to take a month off from work to help her siblings with their school-work so that their grades did not drop.

  <div class="note note-danger mb-1" >
    <strong><i class="far fa-hand-point-right mx-2 text-primary"></i></strong> The website was also found by a few children in Siya's youngest son’s school. He was subjected to so much bullying by his school-mates that he used to cry and refuse to go to school for extended periods of time. Nothing has changed even now despite complaints to the school staff about this harassment. The bullying has now become so bad that Siya is considering changing his school.

    <strong><i class="far fa-hand-point-right mx-2 text-primary"></i></strong>Due to the extreme stress, deep anguish and the fear resulting from everything that Mridu subjected upon Siya, Siya has been diagnosed with severe depression and an incurable condition called Fibromyalgia. The pain from Fibromyalgia is so unbearable despite medication, that even day-to-day activities are extremely difficult to accomplish. Because of these serious physical and mental health issues, Siya had to leave her job and she has been without any source of income for almost a year now. Medical bills have piled up from all the doctor's appointments and medications which insurance does not completely cover. With Siya not earning, she cannot afford to pay these bills nor support her family.

          <p class="text-muted lh-lg " style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-up"> Our mind and intelligence are the biggest gifts if used constructively. But, some people choose to misuse this gift to ruin the lives of other people. Mridu Arya is one such person who has used all her resources to destroy the lives of at least 10 people, including that of her own son. There might be more.</p>
                                                     
           <p class="text-muted lh-lg " style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-up"> Mridu has had ample opportunities to reform through the years. Her ex-husband suggested marriage counseling on many occasions during their marriage to keep it alive for the sake of their son. All these suggestions were shot down by Mridu. Her friends tried to talk to her and urged her to get anger management classes. She ignored their sound advice. After the divorce was filed, each of her 5 attorneys tried to advise her to finish the divorce case quickly and to move on with her life. Instead of heeding their advice, she fired them. She then continued on her path of harassment and defamation to further her nefarious agenda, including the misuse of law enforcement, judiciary and other public institutions. For all her felony-worthy offenses, Mridu has herself managed to stay out of the clutches of law enforcement for too long now.</p>
            
            <p class="text-muted lh-lg " style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-up">The goal of this website is to bring out into the open Mridu’s evil personality, and to caution people who might be interacting with her or might interact with her in the future. Another goal of this website is to make people aware that it is sometimes very difficult to recognize intimate partner violence (IPV)[3]. If you are being victimized in a relationship, please contact institutions like CORA[4] to educate yourself about how you can keep yourself safe, both mentally and physically, and how to remedy the situation that you are in.

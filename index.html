        <p >This entire restraining order is an attempt to project Mridu’s personality, behavior and misdeeds
          onto me. All offenses mentioned in the filing have in fact been committed by Mridu against me.
          A systematic, calculated, opportunistic and malicious campaign has been launched by Mridu
          against me after I filed for divorce and custody of their minor child after undergoing years of
          physical violence and mental abuse at the hands of Mridu. There is good reason to believe that
          Mridu suffers from mental problems as will be shown below, and I fear for Adarsh’s safety until
          Mridu undergoes a comprehensive psychic evaluation. From my side I have tried to keep this
          divorce a completely respectable and fair process by keeping my distance from Mridu and
          requesting for 50-50 custody of Adarsh, but Mridu on the other hand has been engaging in
          malicious and hurtful activities towards me especially after the divorce by way of getting me
          arrested on a false charge of domestic violence and child abuse, alleging abuse by people who
          have been supporting me in this difficult time and filing this restraining order on completely
          fabricated and manufactured incidents and evidence.</p>

            <p class="display-6 pt-3 text-center text-danger"> ABUSES</p>
            <p class="abuse-para px-2">Ms. Arya had been emotionally and physically abusive throughout our marriage. I was on a work
              visa for the most part of our marriage. She used to say that if I ever called the cops then she
              would make up some story, get me arrested and then I would eventually get deported because I
              was an immigrant. The abuse continued, I did not call the cops because of this threat, and I did
              not collect evidence because I was naive enough to think that this would come in between me
              making my marriage work. I have documented all incidents of abuse over these years, but one
              particular incident stands out. On Dec 3rd 2016, when I was driving on freeway 101N, Ms. Arya
              and Adarsh were in the back seat. We were having an argument, and she started kicking my
              head. When I stopped the car on the shoulder to prevent an accident, she started hitting my
              head with a cell phone. I then called 911 while she was trying to snatch my phone away from
              me. Ms. Arya made up a story that if the cops came, they would take Adarsh away. So, I hung
              up the phone. The 911 operator tried to call me back 3 times, but I did not answer, and I just
              drove back home with a swollen left eye and a swollen head. See Exhibit A for the 911
              transcript.</p>

            <p class="display-6 pt-2 text-center text-warning"> Allegations</p>
            <p class="abuse-para px-2">The allegations that I (and previously Mridu) are/were part of a cult are malicious, defamatory
              and unfounded. It was Mridu that first introduced me to Ms. Shree Lal’s (henceforth referred to
              as Shree, someone whom I consider as my mother) residence on Oct 26th 2011 on the
              occasion of the Indian festival of Diwali. This was the first time I met Shree. I had agreed to go
              only because I was forced by Mridu for doing so. Mridu had emotionally blackmailed me saying
              that if I loved her then I would do as she says. Mridu held Shree in very high standing and on
              the same day mentioned to me that Shree had taken Mridu out of her depression and suicidal
              tendencies from her broken past relationship. Mridu also mentioned on the same day that Shree
              held spiritual prayers every Thursday at her residence from 7.30pm to 8.30pm and that it was an
              event only for close friends and family. Mridu and I started going for the Thursday prayers
              regularly after that point. At no point of time did Shree insist that we come for the Thursday
              prayers nor did she ever question us if we missed Thursday prayers.
              The negative connotation of the word “cult” is implied in the allegations here where it is loosely
              being referred to as a place where people are held against their will, brainwashed and exploited.
              Shree has never invited anyone to these prayer meetings and people only come by the word of
              mouth. Shree has never restrained anyone from leaving this place, people come and go
              completely by their own free will. She has never insisted that anyone pay her money for coming
              to the prayers nor has she ever attempted to brainwash or exploit anyone in any way. This place
              is her residence where she lives with her old mother, handicapped sister and her four children,
              1
              
              and hence she tries to limit the people that come on Thursdays to 20-30 to keep the privacy
              intrusions to a minimum.</p>
